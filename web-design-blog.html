<h2 id="html-jump"><em>HTML</em></h2>
<p> <strong>HTML</strong> is one of the most imprtant codes for programing a website, it basically tells what contents should have your webiste, the way its organized, add images, to change the text and <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italicize</em> some important words. I find that <strong>HTML</strong> coding is a really simple code and skill to learn and memorize and it is also really fun to see the different websites you can create from just changing the arangment and the content of one.</p>
<p> I learned all of the codes of<strong>HTML</strong> in khan academy and with some practice I started costumizing and making my websites each better that the last one, I think that learning <strong>HTML</strong> is one really imporatant and skill that everyone should have the option to learn and that could be usefull in the future. Everyone has this tool abelable at their finger tips youjust look for a yourube video or a website that teaches you <strong>HTML</strong> and you just learn it, besides it is not even that complicated.
<h2 id="css-jump"><em>CSS</em><h2>
<p>
<strong>CSS</strong> is the code where you basicly design your wole website, it is where you can make your website unique so people know its yours and actually see your style that you like using on your website. You can make your websites verry unique and special to your liking. You can do everithing that you want, change the background change the font and the font size, the colors in the wbsite, center the text and add a margin.
</p>
<p>
This code is really simple to learn and to memorize because it is just a simple code that uses some of the <strong>HTML</strong> and it just tells the <strong>HTML</strong> how to look and how to be styled.
